For this hw we use mysql to create a database that would work as an Amazon storefront. The customer is asked which ID to pick from an array of options, then makes the selection and is prompted whether there is any inventory left in stock. After the user makes the selection the database updates the stock and gives the total purchase amount. I had trouble getting hte databuse to update and posting the $ amount left.
